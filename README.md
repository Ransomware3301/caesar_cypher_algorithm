# caesar_cypher_algorithm

C program that implements the Caesar Cypher encryption and decryption algorithms
<br>
<br>
Caesar Cypher is an ancient encryption scheme that is based solely on the displacement of each character $x$ with its encrypted correspondant $x + n$, where $n$ is the _key_ a.k.a. the number of positions to shift the character $x$.
<br>
<br>
Example:
<br>
**Cyphertext**:   "gur creeva cntrf jvyy uryc lbh svaq lbhe pnyyvat ohg qbag or qhcrq phg qbja gur jbbqf gurl or reqbf" <br>
**Plaintext**:   "the perrin pages will help you find your calling but dont be duped cut down the woods they be erdos" <br>
